ðŸŽ“ Information Systems Student | ðŸ‘¾ Game Dev Roots | ðŸ’» Exploring the World of Code

Hey there visitor! Iâ€™m Gabriel. I started my tech journey studying Game Development, where I built a few minigames with Unity and got my first taste of HTML, CSS, and UI design with Figma.

Now Iâ€™m diving deeper into tech through my Information Systems degree. Iâ€™ve been focusing on sharpening my skills in HTML, CSS, and Java (working with IntelliJ), and Iâ€™m always looking for ways to learn more and build cool stuff.
